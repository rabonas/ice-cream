                    <p className="intro__text">In the sixteenth century, the emperors of the Mughal Empire used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to Delhi, where it was used in fruit sorbets. Qulfi (also known as Kulfi) is a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent and is often described as "traditional South Asian ice cream". It originated in the sixteenth century in the Mughal Empire and was actually adopted from bastani sonnati, a Persian ice cream.</p>
